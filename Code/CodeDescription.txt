Codes for solving the Dirichlet Laplace-Beltrami Equation on the Sphere
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Codes are divided by chapter in self contained folders
All scripts which generate figures/results in the thesis are included

- Codes for Chapters 4, 6, and 7 contain the main scripts used for obtaining all numerical results :


CHAPTER 4 : Numerical Results
------------------------------

The fast direct solver is explained in the most detail in 
* main_FastDirectSolver

The associated functions called are : 
OMNICONT_compress_HSS_dsym_brute - brute force compression
OMNICONT_compress_HSS_dsym_green - proxy point compression

which in turn call : 
OMNICONT_construct_A_diag  - constructs diagonal blocks
OMNICONT_construct_A_offd  - constructs off-diagonal blocks
OMNICONT_construct_A_sing  - constructs reduced off-diagonal blocks with proxy points
OMNICONT_construct_Atilde  - constructs sparse matrix for UMFPACK
OMNICONT_construct_contour - constructs boundary contour


* main_Ex4_1 : outputs results corresponding to Example 4.1

    Since this example takes a long time to run I have output values saved from the run I 
    used in the thesis: 
    * Ex4-1Results.mat 
    These results are plotted in: 
    * PlotResults_Ex4_1.m
 
* main_Ex4_2 : outputs results corresponding to Example 4.2 
    
    I also have outputs for this example in 
    * Ex4-2Results.mat
    which are plotted in 
    * PlotResults_Ex4_2.m
